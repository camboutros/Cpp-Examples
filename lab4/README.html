This is a non-credit lab, in preparation for an upcoming project
which will involve using OpenGL, which is a graphics toolkit.&nbsp;
There is nothing to submit or grade.&nbsp;
<P>
<H1>X11</H1>
<P>
In order to run an X11 application on the server and have
it display on your own local workstation, you will need to
install an X11 client.&nbsp;
<P>

http://its.ucsc.edu/unix-timeshare/tutorials/setting-up-x2go.html</A>
<BR>
describes one such method of doing this.&nbsp;
<P>
Linux:&nbsp;
You don't need this, because Linux has X11 installed.&nbsp;
<P>
OSX:&nbsp;
You could use x2go, or download Apple's X11 utility.&nbsp;
<P>
Windoze:&nbsp;
X2go, xming, something?
<P>
How do you know you have X11 installed?
<BR><TT>ssh -X </TT><I>username</I><TT>@unix.ucsc.edu</TT>
<P>
Once you have logged in type any X11 command, such as
<BR><TT>xclock &</TT>
<P>
Note the <TT>&</TT> at the end of the line.&nbsp;

<H1>OpenGL</H1>
<P>

<P>
OpenGL will be net-intensive, especially if you have a slow
internet connection.&nbsp;
So you may want to download OpenGL onto your own computer.&nbsp;
<P>
Testing OpenGL on the server.&nbsp;
Copy these files into your own directory and type:&nbsp;
<BR><TT>make test</TT>
<P>
The Hello World window should open up if you X11 client
is working correctly.&nbsp;
<P>
Copy these file to your own computer and type:&nbsp;
<BR><TT>make test</TT>
<P>
If you have OpenGL correctly installed, the Hello window
will open.&nbsp;
<P>
Note:&nbsp;
You are not expected to understand anything in
<TT>hello-gl.cpp</TT>
at this time,
just that it somehow makes use of the OpenGL libraries.
